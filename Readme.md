## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the major things i learned while working through this project was the CSS Transform property. I used the TranslateX() function to change the position of ratings section in my CSS code. Here are some code snippets below:

```CSS
#rate1{
    transform: translateX(44%);
    }

#rate2 {
  transform: translateX(56%);
  }

#rate3 {
    transform: translateX(67%);
}
```

I also used the GRID property for the layout of the whole page.

### Continued development

Areas that I want to focus on in future projects

- CSS Transform
- CSS GRID

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1] (Learningwebdesign by Jennifer Robbins) - This book really helped me solidify my CSS knowledge and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to startoff their webdesign career.
- [Resource 2] (Responsive webdesign with HTML5 nad CSS3 by Ben Frain) - This is another book that really helped me to know the ins and outs of mobile-first responsive web design. I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a complete book on responsive web design.
